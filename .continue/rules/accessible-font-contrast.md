Ensure all text has sufficient contrast ratios that meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards: at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18pt or 14pt bold). Use text-gray-800 on light backgrounds and text-gray-200 on dark backgrounds. For colored text, verify contrast with tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker.
